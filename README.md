# Inefficient Recursive Fibonacci

This repository demonstrates an inefficient recursive implementation of the Fibonacci sequence in Python and provides an optimized solution.

The original implementation suffers from redundant calculations, leading to exponential time complexity.  The solution showcases a dynamic programming approach for significant performance improvement.
